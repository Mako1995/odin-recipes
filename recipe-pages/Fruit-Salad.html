        <h2>History</h2>
        The concept of fruit salad was probably introduced during the US Naval Era, perhaps in the early 1900s. 
        While ancient CHamorus ate mangoes, papayas, young coconuts (månha), bananas and other native fruits, 
        the mixing of a variety of fruits with a sweet sauce is distinctly Western.
        Fruit salad as it is known today (a mixture of fresh fruits, canned fruits and sweetener) comes from the mid 1800s. 
        There are several forms of fruit salads that use mayonnaise (Waldorf fruit salad) that is popular in Europe; or oranges and sour cream (Ambrosia) popular in America; 
        and others that use coconut and condensed milk, popular in the Philippines and Guam.
