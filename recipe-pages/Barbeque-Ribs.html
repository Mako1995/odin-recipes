        <h2>History</h2>
        If there is any one food that could give apple pie, hot dogs, or burgers a run for its money as being true American cuisine, it would be BBQ. 
        The tradition of cooking the meat slow and low over indirect heat has become so popular that it has spawned an entire culture. BBQ has a long history, 
        at times touched by controversy, as is imminent by the BBQ feuds of the South. And, the history of ribs is deeply submerged in this culture. 
        The history of BBQ ribs is as diverse as BBQ itself. Itâ€™s a path that began in the Caribbean, traveled north by Spanish Conquistadors, 
        moved overseas to the Americas, and then seasoned with flavors of European settlers.
