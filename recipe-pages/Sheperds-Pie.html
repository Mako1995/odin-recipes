        <h2>History</h2>
        Shepherdâ€™s Pie first came about late in the 1700s and early 1800s. Accordingly, housewives back then were on the frugal side. 
        Much like we do today, they were looking for ways to incorporate those leftovers that husbands and kids would turn up their noses at. 
        The struggle was real back then just like today. Shepherd's Pie comes to us from England, and is traditionally made with lamb or mutton. 
        In the states we are more of a beef eating culture than a lamb eating one, and when one is served "shepherd's pie" here, it is most often made with ground beef.
